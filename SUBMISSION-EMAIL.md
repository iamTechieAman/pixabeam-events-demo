Dear PixaBeam HR Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to submit my completed assessment for the Database Management role at PixaBeam.

I have successfully completed both parts of the assessment and am excited to share my work with you.

## 📋 Part 1: Database Design - COMPLETED ✅

I have designed and implemented a comprehensive database schema for an events platform using Supabase (PostgreSQL):

**Database Components:**
- Users Table: User management with UUID primary keys and email uniqueness
- Events Table: Event details with proper foreign key relationships
- RSVPs Table: RSVP management with enum status (Yes/No/Maybe)

**Key Features:**
- Referential integrity with proper foreign key constraints
- Cascade deletes for data consistency
- Indexed queries for optimal performance
- Comprehensive sample data (10 users, 5 events, 20 RSVPs)

**Deliverables:**
- Complete SQL schema with tables, constraints, and sample data
- ER diagram showing database relationships
- Detailed design documentation explaining all decisions

## 🚀 Part 2: Full-Stack Application - COMPLETED ✅

I have built and deployed a production-ready events platform:

**Technical Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time APIs)
